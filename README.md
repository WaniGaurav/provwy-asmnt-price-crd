# BOGO Offer Dynamic Selection

This project demonstrates a dynamic BOGO (Buy One Get One) offer selection with different units and discounts. It includes an interactive UI where the user can select the quantity (1 unit, 2 units, or 3 units) and customize product options such as size and color. The total price is dynamically updated based on the user's selection.

## Features

- **Interactive product selection**: Choose between different product options such as size and color for each unit.
- **Dynamic Price Calculation**: The price updates automatically based on the selected unit and applied discount.
- **Hover Effect**: Hovering over a selection box shows a subtle visual effect to indicate it is interactive.
- **Radio Buttons**: Each product selection is controlled by radio buttons, with one option being selected at a time.
- **Free Delivery**: Display of free shipping information and the final total for the selected items.
- **Add to Cart**: Button to simulate adding the selected offer to the cart.
